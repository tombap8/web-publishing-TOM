          A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable
          of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically.[2] A robot
          can be guided by an external control device, or the control may be
          embedded within. Robots may be constructed to evoke human form, but
          most robots are task-performing machines, designed with an emphasis on
          stark functionality, rather than expressive aesthetics.
          <br /><br />
          Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids
          such as Honda's Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility (ASIMO) and
          TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial robots,
          medical operating robots, patient assist robots, dog therapy robots,
          collectively programmed swarm robots, UAV drones such as General
          Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking
          a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a
          sense of intelligence or thought of its own. Autonomous things are
          expected to proliferate in the future, with home robotics and the
          autonomous car as some of the main drivers.[3]
          <br /><br />
          The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction,
          operation, and application of robots,[4] as well as computer systems
          for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is
          robotics. These technologies deal with automated machines that can
          take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing
          processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, or cognition.
          Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the
          field of bio-inspired robotics. These robots have also created a newer
          branch of robotics: soft robotics.
          <br /><br />
          From the time of ancient civilization, there have been many accounts
          of user-configurable automated devices and even automata resembling
          humans and other animals, such as animatronics, designed primarily as
          entertainment. As mechanical techniques developed through the
          Industrial age, there appeared more practical applications such as
          automated machines, remote-control and wireless remote-control.
          <br /><br />
          The term comes from a Slavic root, robot-, with meanings associated
          with labor. The word 'robot' was first used to denote a fictional
          humanoid in a 1920 Czech-language play R.U.R. (Rossumovi Univerzální
          Roboti – Rossum's Universal Robots) by Karel Čapek, though it was
          Karel's brother Josef Čapek who was the word's true inventor.[5][6][7]
          Electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the
          advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by William
          Grey Walter in Bristol, England in 1948, as well as Computer Numerical
          Control (CNC) machine tools in the late 1940s by John T. Parsons and
          Frank L. Stulen.
          <br /><br />
          The first modern digital and programmable robot was invented by George
          Devol in 1954 and spawned his seminal robotics company, Unimation. The
          first Unimate was sold to General Motors in 1961 where it lifted
          pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the Inland Fisher
          Guide Plant in the West Trenton section of Ewing Township, New
          Jersey.[8]
          <br /><br />
          Robots have replaced humans[9] in performing repetitive and dangerous
          tasks which humans prefer not to do, or are unable to do because of
          size limitations, or which take place in extreme environments such as
          outer space or the bottom of the sea. There are concerns about the
          increasing use of robots and their role in society. Robots are blamed
          for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in
          increasing numbers of functions.[10] The use of robots in military
          combat raises ethical concerns. The possibilities of robot autonomy
          and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be
          a realistic concern in the future.
